## The Adapter Pattern
Converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter Lets class work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## The Facade Pattern
Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
- Talk only to your immediate friends.
